# Personal Dev Blog created with React

## The idea

Companies tend to look for personal projects when you lack many years of experience or when they feel like trying to know you better, so a dev blog is a pretty standard idea to show off some of your skills as a developer.

This repository will contain only the **front end** code and responsabilities, I am not running a MVC-style project.

## Running it locally

### 1- Requirements

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. 
- Not a must, but it would be nice to have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed just for convenience

If, for some reason, you still don't have those installed, it is recommended to use a **PACKAGE MANAGER** even if you are a Windows user, because if you wish to remove them later, the package manager (like Chocolatey, or the current built-in winget) will deal with the removal of dependencies and additional trash that can be left behind. 

If you are a linux user, just use your distro's main package manager (apt, pacman, etc.)

### 2- Actually running the project

To run it locally, clone the repo and run
`npm install` or `yarn install` to download the dependencies to your node_modules folder.

Afterwards, just run `npm start` or `yarn start` and you're good to go
